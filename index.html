                        <h3>About this Site</h3>
                        <p>I first had this idea within our first 2 weeks of dating. Not having any experience in front-end coding or web design (thanks a lot Brandeis),
                            I decided to give you the jar when we went long distance for the first time instead. When I started work in August, I decided to resurrect the idea
                            and took a few courses on HTML, CSS, UX/UI, and JavaScript to prepare. This was maybe the only thing I liked about your long hours at VCA (shoutout to Stephanie).
                            After finally getting the code to work, I reached out to some friends and family who were more than happy to show their love and appreciation
                            of just how incredible of a person you are. 
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            <p>I feel like it's cliche to say how I fell in love with you on our first date (which I did). So I'm going 
                                to chose our second one for this story. Our 2nd date, as you remember, was probably like 12 hours long. We
                                hammocked at UCLA (pic below!), saw some cute dogs, ordered some terrible tacos, and hung out at the Bayit's basement (also the first
                                time I treid your baking). Somewhere in those 12 hours that still didn't feel like long enough, I told you that my
                                favorite flavor of candy is always the red ones. I even forgot I told you about this until for my birthday later that year,
                                you got me a giant bag of red flavored candy--each that you sorted out yourself so I wouldn't have to pick out the ones I like.
                                While it took me a solid month to finish, I was and am floored by your ability to care and listen.

                            <p>Sammi, my coo, I have never met anyone who knows me as well as you do. If I told myself a few years ago all of the new
                                things I've tried and liked because of you, I wouldn't believe it. I drink coffee sometimes, am obsessed with Abba, love me some Noah 
                                Kahan, and Heck, can you believe we have a cat? You show me all these things I didn't know I wanted, while at the same time
                                making me feel respected if I like it or not. xoxo Gossip Girl.
