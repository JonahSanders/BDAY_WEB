                <h3>Ava Zarifpour</h3> <br>
                <p>Hi I‚Äôm Ava, Sammi‚Äôs best friend. When I first met Sammi in 2020, I knew that I wanted to be her future roommate. Like actually. When I found out that she was moving into the Bayit, I asked (begged) the RA‚Äôs to room us together because of how well we hit it off and how normal she seemed (boy, was I proven wrong! Jk‚Ä¶..).
                    <br><br>
                    In that short first meeting, I could tell that Sammi was just such a well-rounded, caring, intelligent person. Almost 3 years later and she is someone I call ‚Äúthe sister I never had‚Äù or ‚Äúthe second Zarifpour daughter‚Äù (it alternates). 
                    <br><br>
                    I appreciate Sammi for always being herself, as cheesy as that sounds. She has taught me how to unapologetically be myself and to set health boundaries. When in doubt, I often think, ‚Äúwhat would Sammi do?‚Äù She gives the best advice and has so much empathy and gentleness when weighing options which is why I feel like I can always depend on her. 
                    <br><br>
                    When I‚Äôve been at my worst Sammi was by my side, holding the popcorn bowl. When I was at my best, Sammi was cheering me on and routing for me. She‚Äôs been there for me in moments that I would only expect family to be there for and the best part was that she has never judged me‚Äînot once. 
                    <br><br>
                    Sammi is a gem. To watch her grow into who she is over the years has been magical and I am so proud of who she is, how hard she has worked, and the choices she‚Äôs made (Jonah being one of them. Nice.). 
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you, Sammi for being my best friend. I love you so much‚ù§Ô∏è

                <p>Samamay,<br>
                    <br>From the very moment I met you, I just knew deep in my bones that we would be lifelong friends. 
                    I feel so fortunate to have a friend like you that has seen me at my most awkward, most vulnerable, 
                    most full of myself‚Ä¶ and everything in between. Just remember, the true blackmailing comes at your wedding. <br>
                    <br>
                    You are such a loving, goofy soul. I just know that you will approach whatever professional and personal pursuits 
                    come your way with openness, passion, and humor. Today we celebrate the very special person you are!! Cheers to 23 years of 
                    Sammi‚Äôs existence and 13 years of friendship. God knows I‚Äôd still be in the Yosemite woods without you. I love you! Happy birthday üéà

                <p>There is a teaching that on your birthday, hashem decided that the world cannot continue without you. <br><br>
                    I wish you an amazing year of personal growth and strengthening of connections. <br><br>
                    I have so many fond memories of hanging out with you at the bayit. Taking care of Fiona, going on walks in Beverly Hills, getting boba at that place that I had a punch card, along with many others. 
                    <br><br>Thank you for being a great person to talk to whenever I was down, helping with my essays, and also thank you for encouraging me to read more often. 
                    <br><br>Had we been closer outside of covid, I would have loved to go on larger adventures, but I think that we played the cards that we have been given quite nicely.
                    <br><br> Be grateful for the unknown blessings already on your way!
